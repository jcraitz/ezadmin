# About the Project #

EZadmin is a free, open source, administrative tool that can be used to manage resource configurations for [EZproxy](http://www.oclc.org/ezproxy/), a very popular proxy server used in libraries. It provides a web interface for library staff to edit resource configurations, which are stored in a MySQL database. These configuration can then be exported via the web interface to create actual configuration files for EZproxy.
